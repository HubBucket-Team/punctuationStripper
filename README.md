# punctuationStripper
This simple program removes all the punctuation except for . and ' from every .txt file in the directory it's run in. As it's currently written it will also remove non-English characters. It's really simple but I figured someone else might find it helpful at some point. 

To use: 
Save file in the same directory as the files you want to remove punctuation from.
Open the console, navigate to that directroy and run.
